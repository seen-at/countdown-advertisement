A future date is set initially. Using the function getTime(), the time in milliseconds of the current date and the future date is obtained. Calculation is done with the function to extract the remaining dasys, hours, minutes and seconds. 

Real-time countdown is done using setInterval() function. The parameters include the callback function to be called inside it and the number of times it will be called. 
The countdown tiles are cleared once the difference in milliseconds reaches 0. This is done with the clearInterval() function.
